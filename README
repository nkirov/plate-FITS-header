Wide-Field Plate Database (WFPDB) is the basic source of data for the wide-field (larger or equal of 1 square degree) astronomical photographic plates obtained with 
professional telescopes world-wide (see wfpdb.org). It consists of four parts: Catalogue of Wide-Field Plate Archives (CWFPAs); Catalogue of Wide-Field Plate 
Indexes (CWFPIs) with regularly updated version (now for 563600 plates); Data Bank of digitized plate images (with low resolution for quick plate visualization and easy 
on-line access, and with high resolution aiming photometric and astrometric measurements); Links to on-line services and cross-correlation with other existing catalogues 
and journals.

Flexible Image Transport System or FITS is a digital file format used to store, transmit, and manipulate scientific and other images (fits.gsfc.nasa.gov). A major feature of the FITS 
format is that image meta-data is stored in a human-readable ASCII header. Each FITS file consists of a header containing ASCII card images (80 character fixed-length strings) that 
carry keyword/value pairs and an image data block.

Creation of complete FITS header is an important part of plates digitization. Because the photographic plates are a specific type of astronomical observations, we attempt to make 
a standard of the keywords in the FITS header, specially for astronomical photographic plates. The corresponding software implementation for this standard is also created. It is written in 
C++ using Qt cross platform application. When we generate FITS header for scanned plates, WFPDB catalogues are used for obtaining the most important meta-data for the plates.
